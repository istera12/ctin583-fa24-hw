    TODO: Problem 2: We are trying to move our player in an open world game. We would like the player to be able to move
    foward, backward, left, and right. In addition, the player should be able to jump and adapt to the world's gravity.
    First, we will need to define some variables in order to control our player with the WASD keys and the Space bar for it to jump. 
    Please define the following private variables and print them out to Unity's console: 
                1. Player or Character's Name
                2. Movement Speed as a float
                3. Gravity Value as a float
                4. Jump Speed as a float
    
    When the game starts, we would like to find our character. In our Unity Editor, we have a 3D model of our player and the player is 
    represented as a component in Unity. How do we grab our player controller in code and where should we write this line of code in this
    C# document (PlayerController.cs)?
